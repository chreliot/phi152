      <description>For feedback and grades on your [Assignments] and [Tests] for this course, we will be using the web app Gradescope, which is newly supported by Hofstra.
Before you can view any of your graded submissions, you will need to create an account with Gradescope. You will receive an email directly from Gradescope with a link for logging in.
No student has yet reported having difficulty with this process, so—having not used it myself from the student—I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</description>

      <description>Mid-semester Advisories Hofstra faculty issue mid-semester advisories in the seventh week of the semester to let students know if they think there is a reason for concern, at that early stage, about their performance so far in the course. It is a preliminary flag, early in the semester, that there may be reason for concern at that point. As the Provost&amp;rsquo;s website instructs:
it is expected that students receive early advisory that reflects on their progress in their courses.</description>

      <description>Bayesianism, as an approach to inductive reasoning, focuses on updating our beliefs in light of new evidence. It is built around a simple formula that expresses a relationship between probabilities.
Reading Hacking, Chapter 7 “Bayes&amp;rsquo; Rule” (pages 69–77) Hacking, Chapter 15 “Learning from Experience” (pages 171–188) Hacking, Chapter 21 “Learning from Experience as an Evasion of the Problem of Induction” (4 pages) — and if you&amp;rsquo;re not feeling sufficiently familiar with “the problem of induction” (from our discussion of Hume), optionally look at the first pages of Chapter 20 Slides Introducing Bayesianism Learning questions What do each of the terms mean in the basic version of Bayes&amp;rsquo;s Rule?</description>

      <description>Here we set up some basic ideas about probability which will are necessary for understanding the approaches to scientific justification scientists have used most during the last fifty years.
Reading Hacking, Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic Chapter 3 “The Gambler&amp;rsquo;s Fallacy” This chapter introduces the basic concepts randomness, independence, and probability model but overall it&amp;rsquo;s pitched to give you a feel for some probability ideas. You might read it more quickly than Chapter 4↓.</description>

      <description>As modern science emerged, its practitioners tried to describe how they were reasoning, and how others should reason, to do science. They came to quite different answers! This unit looks quickly at a few landmarks from the period 1600–1965.
Reading Francis Bacon, The New Organon (1620). Read Book 2, sections 10–16 (bottom right of page 53 to page 64 of the linked PDF). Focus on the figuring out the overall method, skimming the specific scientific information in the middle to get a general sense of what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>This is the participation rubric to be used for grading participation in this course. Read it as saying “A student who demonstrates … earns a grade of X,” where X is the letter grade at the top of the column.1
A B C D F Active role in discussions, drawing on texts Regular, constructive participation drawing on texts Inconsistent constructive participation based on texts Vague comments reflecting limited engagement with texts Persistent lack of engagement with texts Full preparation for approximately every class Substantial preparation, normally Inconsistent evidence of preparation Rare evidence of participation No positive evidence of participation Success at advancing level and depth of discussion, persistently Regular contributions based on assigned material, which sometimes improve discussion and never diminish it Rare or no significant contribution to the level of discussion while not reducing it Activity sometimes diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment Activity regularly diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment Active engagement with and listening to peers, persistently Sincere efforts to interact with peers, normally Limited engagement with peers Rare interaction with peers No interaction with peers This rubric is significantly based on, and lightly adapted from, one shared by another philosophy professor, Jay Odenbaugh.</description>

      <description>This note about grading and interpreting grades just adds some detail to what the course syllabus already says about grading.
4-point scale Grades in this course are assigned and calculated using Hofstra&amp;rsquo;s 4-point scale (described here in the Hofstra Bulletin). Following the Bulletin, the alphabetical grades, including plus (+) and minus (–), have the following 4-point scale values (and vice versa):

      <description>Does science have a logic? Could it be what we call “deductive logic,” (which is the focus of other courses like PHI 154 Symbolic Logic)? What is deductive logic? Is non-deductive logic possible? What could “inductive logic” be? Could it be the logic of science?

      <description>Decision theory offers a framework for using knowledge to make decisions. To do this, it offers a way of integrating probabilities and values. And it offers some guidelines for choosing different probability/value combinations under different conditions.
Reading Hacking, “Expected Value,” chapter 8 of Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic. Read pages 79–82 with care. Hacking, “Maximizing Expected Value,” chapter 9 of Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic. Read pages 98–108. Hacking, “Decision under Uncertainty,” chapter 10 of Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic Optional reading I&amp;rsquo;ve selected 15 total pages for you from Chapters 8–9, but there is a lot else that&amp;rsquo;s interesting in those chapters.</description>

      <description>Our first test will take place during class on March 15.
Content We opened the course with the idea of logic, thinking about the possibility of a logic of scientific reasoning. We developed enough understanding of deductive logic to understand examples of it, and its strengths and limitations. We then contrasted it with the idea of inductive logic, thinking about its goals and limitations, as well. We considered, in a way that continued into our examination of various philosophers&amp;rsquo;s accounts, what roles deductive and inductive logic each might play in scientific reasoning.</description>

      <description>Next, we examine the second main, contemporary approach to scientific reasoning, based in the frequentist understanding of probability. At the heart of its reasoning is the “double negative” inference, based in the “probabilistic modus tollens.” The jargon name for this approach is “null hypothesis significance testing.” We will observe how and why it works, building up from some foundational concepts.
Reading Hacking, Chapter 17 “Normal Approximations” (via Course Documents on Blackboard) Hacking, Chapter 18 “Significance and Power” (note on type I/II error) Slides Introducing null-hypothesis testing Introduction to population sampling and correlation Learning questions How does the relative frequency interpretation of probability give rise to a way of justifying scientific knowledge?</description>

      <description>Upload your answer as “Assignment 1” on Gradescope. An email with information about how to upload will follow.
For this exercise, you will present several arguments, each in the form of a list of two or more sentences — with at least three usually making things easier! — the last of which is the conclusion. The phrases in each sentence should fit together to make the logical relationships among them clear.</description>

      <title>Topic 6: Causation</title>

      <guid>http://chreliot.github.io/phi152/topics/causation/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed what correlations are, and how they are related to sampling from a population via basic probability ideas. But we noted that correlation isn&amp;rsquo;t causation, and that researchers are quite often interested in causation. Here we take up how it might be possible to investigate causal relationships, and some of the challenges and limitations inherent to doing that.
