<h1><span class="title">Test 2 Questions</span></h1>

</div>

<main>
<p>The questions for our second test follow. They stick very closely to your readings and what we emphasized in class.</p>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list; it&rsquo;s now <strong>complete</strong>.  The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here. There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, to display your understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why might someone believe there are no &ldquo;objective&rdquo; probabilities?</li>
<li>How would personal and interpersonal interpretations of probability interpret the statement “The probability of finding true love is .6”? And what is the difference between the two interpretations?</li>
<li>How would relative-frequency and propensity interpretations of probability interpret the statement “The probability of finding true love is .6”? And what is the difference between those two interpretations?</li>
<li>What are the inputs and outputs for a typical application of Bayes&rsquo;s theorem to inductive, scientific reasoning? Then in a sentence, what does it show?</li>
<li>If you want to know whether a hypothesis is true, how would you use a null-hypothesis significance test to evaluate it?</li>
<li>What can null-hypothesis significance tests tell us about correlations? What is a common misconception about what they can tell us?</li>
<li>In the context of null-hypothesis significance testing, what is a p-value?</li>
<li>What is one common kind of error people make in interpreting p-values, and why is it an error?</li>
<li>What is “p-hacking,” and why is it a problem?</li>
<li>If we can&rsquo;t observe causation, how/why might randomized controlled trials help reveal causal relationships?</li>
<li>What does a standard deviation measure? And if we say that some value is within one standard deviation of the mean, what does that mean?</li>
<li>Why exactly is sample size important for significance in a randomized controlled trial?</li>
<li>What, in a randomized trial, should be randomized? And why exactly should it be randomized?</li>
<li>What is one of the main cautions offered by Deaton and Cartrwight for using or interpreting randomized controlled trials?</li>
<li>Given a box diagram (illustrated), does it show positive evidence for (two variables) being significantly correlated, or not?</li>
<li>What is the expected value of an action? In what kind of case might we reasonably prefer an action which does not maximize expected value?</li>
<li>Use a decision matrix to describe an imaginary case where taking a medication has higher expected value than not taking it.</li>
