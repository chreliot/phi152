<main>
<p>The questions for our second test follow. They stick very closely to your readings and what we emphasized in class.</p>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list, when it is complete. (The list is currently <strong>incomplete</strong>, and more questions will be added.) The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here. There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, to display your understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why might someone believe there are no &ldquo;objective&rdquo; probabilities?</li>
<li>How would personal and interpersonal interpretations of probability interpret the statement “The probability of finding true love is .6”? And what is the difference between the two interpretations?</li>
<li>How would relative-frequency and propensity interpretations of probability interpret the statement “The probability of finding true love is .6”? And what is the difference between those two interpretations?</li>
<li>What is Bayes&rsquo;s rule (either version)? What — in just a phrase each — do each of its terms mean? (By “term” I mean things like “P(H|E)” or “P(E).”)</li>
</ol>
