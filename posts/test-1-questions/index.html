</div>

<main>
<p>The questions for our first test follow. They stick very closely to your readings and what we emphasized in class.</p>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here. There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, to display your understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Was scholasticism scientific? How <em>or</em> how not?</li>
<li>What does Osler&rsquo;s example of dissection theaters suggest about why scholastic methodology resisted change for so long?</li>
<li>If we could do science entirely using deductive logic, why would that be a good thing? Explain.</li>
<li>Present a syllogism that is deductively valid, but which has false premises and a false conclusion. Then: How can it still be valid?</li>
<li>Present a two-premise, inductively-strong argument that is <em>not</em> deductively valid. Explain why it is inductively strong.</li>
<li>What is “affirming the consequent”? Why is it a fallacy? What relevance does it being a fallacy have to our discussion of the scientific method?</li>
<li>What does Bacon endorse and reject about science in presenting the metaphor of spiders, ants, and bees?</li>
<li>What do the Bacon&rsquo;s tables try to show? How?</li>
<li>Why does Newton recommend against using hypotheses to do science? What would be the alternative?</li>
<li>Why might we think Newton doesn&rsquo;t actually follow his own advice in saying “I don&rsquo;t use hypotheses”? Could we argue that he actually does use hypotheses? Then, what might Newton say to deny that?</li>
<li>Some people say that scientists&rsquo; successful predictions confirm theories. How does Hempel&rsquo;s Semmelweis example show that that is not always right?</li>
<li>In Hempel&rsquo;s example, in what ways did Semmelweis reason <em>well</em> about childbed fever?</li>
<li>Why, according to Popper, should scientific hypotheses have low probability?</li>
<li>How, according to Popper, could scientific reasoning be essentially deductive (and not inductive)?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s mistaken about suggesting that first scientists should “collect all the relevant facts” and then “analyze and classify them”?</li>
<li>Why can&rsquo;t scientists use “mechanically applicable rules” (Hempel says) to inductively infer generalizations from basic facts?</li>
</ol>
