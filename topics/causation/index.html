</div>

<main>
<p>We&rsquo;ve discussed what correlations are, and how they are related to sampling from a population via basic probability ideas. But we noted that correlation isn&rsquo;t causation, and that researchers are quite often interested in causation. Here we take up how it might be possible to investigate causal relationships, and some of the challenges and limitations inherent to doing that.</p>

<h2 id="learning-questions">Learning questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are several ways variables X and Y could be correlated, despite that X does not cause Y?</li>
<li>What defines the “regularity” account of causation?
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s plausible about it?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s problematic about it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the “manipulability” account of causation differ from the regularity account?
<ul>
<li>What is a criticism philosophers aim at manipulability accounts?</li>
<li>How does Woodward reply to it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the standard way of studying causation in populations?
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the reasoning behind using this research method, and what reason do we have, based on the structure of this research method, for thinking that it can sometimes reveal evidence of causal relationships?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the main arguments Deaton and Cartwright offer about randomized controlled trials?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="consider">Consider</h2>
<ol>
<li>In what ways does it matter and/or not matter to science to have an account of what causation <em>is</em>?</li>
<li>How well do the accounts of causation we discussed seem to you to capture what causation <em>is</em>?</li>
<li>Does scientific inquiry ever do better than randomized controlled trials can at investigating causal relationships (and distinguishing them from non-causal relationships). Could it? Why? How?</li>
<li>What do you take away as the lessons for when you read reports of causal associations? That is, correlation is not causation—sure; so how do you approach causal claims?</li>
