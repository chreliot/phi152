<p>Our second test, on Wednesday May 18, will be in our regular classroom, but at our registrar-assigned time, 8 AM. It will be designed to take an hour or a little more than that. You will have until 10 AM to finish it.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This test will cover the whole course, but with a strong emphasis on the second half. In the second half of the course, we covered three main topics and one smaller one. We started with five interpretations of probability—of what “probability” means. Then we showed how different interpretations have led to different ideas about how probability can be used to justify (or reject) scientific hypotheses. We focused on the Bayesian approach and the Frequentist approach to justification. We considered how each of those works, how one can reason using them, and what some limitations of — and even objections to — them are. Then, we moved into approaches to recognizing causation, in response to the opening problem from Hume that we do not seem to be able to observe instances of causing per se. We focused on the idea of the randomized, controlled trial as a strategy for studying causation, with an eye to its limitations. Finally, we explored how decision theory uses probabilities to inform decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main ideas for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Presented with a case, you should be able to analyze it using the frameworks we have discussed.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above. A small number of the questions might take some form like lists rather than paragraphs, but they will say so. You will get a blue book to write your answers in. Please bring what you need to write neatly. Pencils are fine.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, to help the understand.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-questions">Actual test questions</h2>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (subject only to correcting any typing/grammar errors). There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, towards displaying your understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Inductive arguments, while never deductively valid, are characterized by having degrees of strength. The Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to justification, being inductive methods, therefore show  support in degrees. What does it mean for a hypothesis to have a “degree of support” in each of the two approaches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are our two main approaches to inductive reasoning (since the mid-twentieth century) each rooted in a different probability concept?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does P(H|E) mean in the context of Bayes&rsquo;s Rule, what are the three terms used by the rule to evaluate P(H|E), and what do they each mean? (This answer could be a list the four terms with their meanings, expressed in at least one sentence each.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s an example (not necessarily with numbers attached) of someone committing the Base Rate Fallacy, and what could Bayes&rsquo;s Rule offer someone committing that error?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might frequentists criticize the Bayesian approach to scientific reasoning? How might Bayesians criticize the frequentist approach to scientific reasoning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You read the sentence in a science paper “Our experiment supported the hypothesis that ducks swim with p &lt; .05,” and the scientists were testing a null hypothesis corresponding to “ducks swim.” What does the “p &lt; .05” mean here? What exactly has the experiment apparently shown?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two common misinterpretations of p-values? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is a probability statement: “There&rsquo;s an 80% chance of thunderstorms at Hofstra tomorrow.” In one sentence each, restate that sentence using each of the five interpretations of probability, without using the word “probability.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just north of New York City, Indian Point nuclear reactor closed last year. Opponents argued, successfully, that a nuclear accident there could be catastrophic for New York City. Advocates of the reactor argued that nuclear power is produced more cleanly and is therefore less harmful than the main alternative, coal-burning power plants, and that accidents are extremely rare. How might laying out a decision table or tables have constructively clarified what exactly they disagree on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a randomized controlled trial seek evidence for causation by trying to gather evidence about <em>imaginary</em> populations? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose your ears ring (a condition called “tinnitus”), and a doctor tells you, “A randomized controlled trial showed that a new drug called Ring-Away works for tinnitus.” First, why is that news? But second, what do Deaton and Cartwright caution about that advice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A randomized controlled trial of twenty runners showed that six of the ten who smoked before running showed increased performance compared to a previous race (never mind how that was measured). But only 4/10 who did not smoke showed increased performance compared to their previous running race. Is smoking correlated with increased performance in this study? Without necessarily calculating anything, do you suspect that this offers positive evidence that smoking helps running? Why or why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of situations (I mean not just just one example, but a <em>set</em>) is expected-value reasoning useful in? What kinds of situations does it probably not give good guidance in (and why not)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[one additional question to be added]</p>
</li>
</ol>
