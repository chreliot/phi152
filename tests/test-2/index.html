<p>Our second test, on Wednesday May 19, will be released at the beginning of the test period (8:00 AM) through a Blackboard announcement (which will also automatically go, more or less immediately, to your email). The test is designed to take one hour. The test will be due by upload at the end of the session (10:00 AM), except for those students who have arranged additional time as allowed by Student Access Services. Submit through the upload link at the course Blackboard site &gt; Tests &gt; Test 2.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This test will cover the whole course, but with a strong emphasis on the second half. In the second half of the course, we covered three main topics and one smaller one. We started with five interpretations of probability—of what “probability” means. Then we showed how different interpretations have led to different ideas about how probability can be used to justify (or reject) scientific hypotheses. We focused on the Bayesian approach and the Frequentist approach to justification. We considered how each of those works, how one can reason using them, and what some limitations of — and even objections to — them are. Then, we moved into approaches to recognizing causation, in response to the opening problem from Hume that we do not seem to be able to observe instances of causing per se. We focused on the idea of the randomized, controlled trial as a strategy for studying causation, with an eye to its limitations. Finally, we explored how decision theory uses probabilities to inform decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main ideas for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Presented with a case, you should be able to analyze it using the frameworks we have discussed.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short (5–8 sentences), separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, to help the understand.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials">Source materials</h2>
<p>You may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else. For the test, you may use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text from non-course materials or other students <em>without mentioning that you have done so</em>  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). And in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> understanding — students repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that they do not understand will not earn good grades. In other words, mentioning the appropriate words won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>
