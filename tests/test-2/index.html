<p>Our second test, on Wednesday May 17, will be in our regular classroom, but at our registrar-assigned time, 8 AM. It will be designed to take an hour or a little more than that. You will have until 10 AM to finish it.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This test will cover the whole course, but with a strong emphasis on the second half. In the second half of the course, we covered three main topics and one smaller one. We started with five interpretations of probability—of what “probability” means. Then we showed how different interpretations have led to different ideas about how probability can be used to justify (or reject) scientific hypotheses. We focused on the Bayesian approach and the Frequentist approach to justification. We considered how each of those works, how one can reason using them, and what some limitations of — and even objections to — them are. Then, we moved into approaches to recognizing causation, in response to the opening problem from Hume that we do not seem to be able to observe instances of causing per se. We focused on the idea of the randomized, controlled trial as a strategy for studying causation in populations, noting some of its limitations. Finally, we explored how decision theory uses probabilities to inform decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main ideas for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Presented with a case, you should be able to analyze it using the frameworks we have discussed.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short, separate paragraphs you will write in response to questions about the content above. A small number of the questions might ask for some specified, alternative structure like lists rather than paragraphs, but otherwise default to paragraphs with complete sentences. The test will provide spaces to write in. Please bring what you need to write neatly. Pencils are fine.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, as if to help them understand.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-questions">Actual test questions</h2>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (subject only to correcting any typing/grammar errors). There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences at minimum. Write in complete, grammatical sentences. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, towards displaying your understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inductive arguments, while never deductively valid, are characterized by having degrees of strength. The Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to justification, being inductive methods, therefore show  support in degrees. In each of the two approaches, what does it mean for a hypothesis to have “a degree of support”? In other words, what exactly is a matter of degree?</li>
<li>How are our two main approaches to inductive reasoning (since the mid-twentieth century) each rooted in a different probability concept?</li>
<li>In what sense does null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) crucially employ &ldquo;double negative&rdquo; reasoning? Explain</li>
<li>In the simplest version of Bayes&rsquo;s rule, what does “P(H|E)” mean, what are the three terms used by the rule to evaluate P(H|E), and what do they each mean? (This answer could be a list the four terms with their meanings, expressed in at least one sentence each.)</li>
<li>How might frequentists criticize the Bayesian approach to scientific reasoning as not providing the sort of answer we want from science? How might Bayesians criticize the frequentists&rsquo; null-hypothesis approach to scientific reasoning as not providing the sort of answer we want from science?</li>
<li>Suppose you read the sentence in a science paper “Our experiment supports the hypothesis that younger ducks fly further with <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05,” and the researchers were testing that hypothesis using null-hypothesis significance testing. What does the “<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05” <em>mean</em> here? What exactly has the research apparently shown?</li>
<li>What are two common misinterpretations of <em>p</em>-values? Explain.</li>
<li>Here is a probability statement: “There&rsquo;s an 80% chance of thunderstorms at Hofstra tomorrow.” In one sentence each, restate that sentence using each of the five interpretations of probability, without using variations of the word &ldquo;probable&rdquo; or  “probability.” In the restatements, bring out the differences between each interpretation.</li>
<li>Just north of New York City, Indian Point nuclear reactor closed last year. Opponents argued, successfully, that a nuclear accident there could be catastrophic for New York City. Advocates of the reactor argued that nuclear power is produced more cleanly and is therefore less harmful than the main alternative, coal-burning power plants, and that accidents are extremely rare. How might laying out a decision table or tables have constructively clarified what exactly they disagree on?</li>
<li>Why might we say that a randomized controlled trial seeks evidence for causation by trying to gather evidence about <em>imaginary</em> populations rather than real ones? Explain.</li>
<li>Suppose your ears ring (a condition called “tinnitus”), and a doctor tells you, “A randomized controlled trial showed that a new drug called No-Ring works for tinnitus.” (a) Why is the support by an RCT good news? (b) What do Deaton and Cartwright caution about that interpreting that advice?</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of twenty runners showed that six of the ten who smoked before running showed increased performance compared to a previous race. (Don&rsquo;t worry about how that was measured.) But only 4/10 who did not smoke showed increased performance compared to their previous running race. Is smoking correlated with increased performance in this study? Without necessarily calculating anything, do you suspect that this offers positive evidence that smoking helps running? Why or why not?</li>
<li>How can we use a Giere-style box-diagram to visualize the support for there being a correlation in a population from a sample? Drw an example use the example of a sample of 100 birds, of which 60 out of 80 tall birds are blue, but only 10 out of 20 short birds are blue. And then explain a sentence or two what it shows.</li>
<li>What strategies do we have for decision making under complete uncertainty, and how might we prioritize them relative to one another?</li>
<li>In what kind of decision-situations — I mean not just just one example, but a kind of situations — is expected-value reasoning useful in? What kinds of situations does it probably <em>not</em> give good guidance in, and why not?</li>
<li>What factors determine whether a correlation in a sample provides evidence of correlation in a population? How and why?</li>
<li>Using a Giere-style box diagram, show an example of a correlation in a population. What kinds of correlations are possible?</li>
<li>Have the twentieth-century approaches to scientific reasoning that characterize much of modern science solved Hume&rsquo;s problem of induction? Why or why not? (This question seeks your course-informed opinion.)</li>
