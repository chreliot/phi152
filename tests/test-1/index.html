<p>Our first test, on Wednesday March 24, will be released at the beginning of the class session (9:40 AM) through a Blackboard announcement (which will automatically also go, at least fairly promptly, to your email). The test is designed to take one hour. You may complete it during the class session, or you may submit it later in the day. Tests submitted any time on March 24 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at the course Blackboard site &gt; Tests &gt; Test 1.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>We opened the course with the idea of logic. We developed enough understanding of deductive logic to understand examples of it, and its strengths and limitations. We then contrasted it with the idea of inductive logic, thinking about its goals and limitations, as well. From there, we moved to surveying the history of scientific reasoning, focusing on ideas and debates about the use of inductive reasoning and the role of hypotheses. After considering the Scholasticism that (arguably) preceded modern science, and its approach to reasoning, we looked at the 17th to the 19th century arguments of Bacon, Newton, Hume, and Whewell. Then, from the twentieth century, we read the contrasting accounts of scientific method of Popper and Hempel. The first test will end with the idea that these last two invoked the idea probability in opposite ways.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main arguments for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of five short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your understanding of the course material.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials">Source materials</h2>
<p>You may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else. For the test, you may use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text from non-course materials or other students <em>without mentioning that you have done so</em>  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). And in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> understanding — students repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that they do not understand will not earn good grades.</p>
