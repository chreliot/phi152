<p>Our first test will take place during class on March 15.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>We opened the course with the idea of logic, thinking about the possibility of a logic of scientific reasoning. We developed enough understanding of deductive logic to understand examples of it, and its strengths and limitations. We then contrasted it with the idea of inductive logic, thinking about its goals and limitations, as well. We considered, in a way that continued into our examination of various philosophers&rsquo;s accounts, what roles deductive and inductive logic each might play in scientific reasoning.  From there, we moved to surveying the history of scientific reasoning, focusing on ideas and debates about (1) the use of inductive reasoning (with Hume as a Skeptic and Bacon and Whewell as optimists of different sorts, and Popper later offering a dodge) and (2) the role of hypotheses (with Newton as a skeptic and Whewell and Hempel in different ways as optimists). Then, from the twentieth century, we read the contrasting accounts of scientific method of Popper and Hempel.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main arguments for each of the readings and/or class presentations. Think about integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Then work through the specific test questions listed below.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above. A small number of the questions might take some form like lists rather than paragraphs, but they will say so. The test will have lined spaces to write in. Please bring what you need to write with neatly. Pencils are fine.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed (on a <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/phi152/notes/interpreting-grades/">0–4 point scale</a>) in terms of how well they present an accurate understanding of the course material.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-questions">Actual test questions</h2>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (subject only to correcting any typing/grammar errors). There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write <em>at least</em> five sentences (minimum), and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, towards displaying your understanding.</p>
<p><em>This list is complete.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>(a) What&rsquo;s the definition of “deductively valid argument”? (b) Give an example of a deductively valid argument (in list form, if you like). (c) What makes an argument inductive?</li>
<li>What is an example of a scientific method that is completely deductive? Note why it&rsquo;s completely deductive.</li>
<li>How does Bacon investigate what heat is?</li>
<li>Why does Newton object to using hypotheses? What could his alternative be?</li>
<li>What does Whewell think justifies inductions? How does it justify them?</li>
<li>Why is confirmation—finding that predictions match observations— <em>not</em> particularly valuable, according to Popper?</li>
<li>Though Popper doesn&rsquo;t use the phrase “scientific method,” what method of reasoning does he prescribe for science?</li>
<li>What does Hempel&rsquo;s characterization of Semmelweis&rsquo;s work reveal about where scientists might get hypotheses from and what makes good hypotheses?</li>
<li>What is wrong, as Hempel discusses, with the advice that scientists should address problems by first collecting all the relevant data and then second classifying it into groups?</li>
<li>What is an argument against hypotheses in scientific method? What about it would Hempel, who thinks hypotheses are necessary, question?</li>
<li>Why does an experiment that results in its predictions being correct only sometimes offer substantial support for a hypothesis?</li>
<li>What argument does Hume pose against inductive reasoning?</li>
<li>How might we argue that we can have knowledge while accepting Hume&rsquo;s reasoning against induction?</li>
</ol>
