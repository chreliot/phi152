      <description>Our first test will, unless circumstances intervene, take place during class on DATE COMING SOON.
Further information coming soon.
How to study To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main arguments for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions.</description>
