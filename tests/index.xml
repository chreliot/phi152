      <description>Our first test will take place during class on March 15.
Content We opened the course with the idea of logic, thinking about the possibility of a logic of scientific reasoning. We developed enough understanding of deductive logic to understand examples of it, and its strengths and limitations. We then contrasted it with the idea of inductive logic, thinking about its goals and limitations, as well. We considered, in a way that continued into our examination of various philosophers&amp;rsquo;s accounts, what roles deductive and inductive logic each might play in scientific reasoning.</description>
