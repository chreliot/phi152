<h1><span class="title">Test 1 Questions</span></h1>

</div>

<main>
<p>This test is designed to take one hour. You may complete it during the class session, or you may submit it later in the day. Tests submitted any time on March 24 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at <code>the course Blackboard site &gt; Tests &gt; Test 1.</code></p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Choose <strong>five (5)</strong> of the questions below under “<strong>Questions</strong>” to work on. For each of those five questions, write a one-paragraph answer, not shorter than five sentences. 6–7 sentences is a good range to aim for, in terms of length (though sentences vary in terms of content, of course, and very brief sentences may not convey as much as I&rsquo;m assuming in my estimate).</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your understanding of the course material. That includes the clarity of the answer, which includes defining any technical or unfamiliar terms you&rsquo;re using and writing in clear English.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials">Source materials</h2>
<p>During the test, you may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else (besides me, and I won&rsquo;t give anyone the answers!). For the test answers, you <em>may</em> use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text <em>from non-course materials or other students, without mentioning that you have done so in the form of a citation</em>,  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). More generally, in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> apparent degree of understanding — test answers repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that the test-takers not seem to understand will not earn good grades.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>(a) What&rsquo;s the definition of “deductively valid argument”? (b) Give an example of a deductively valid argument (in list form, if you like). (c) What makes an argument inductive?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s an example of a completely deductive scientific method?</li>
<li>How does Bacon investigate what heat is?</li>
<li>Why does Newton object to using hypotheses? What would be the alternative?</li>
<li>What is Whewell&rsquo;s contribution to characterizing the scientific method? Explain.</li>
<li>Why are confirmation and verification—finding evidence in favor of a theory— <em>not</em> particularly valuable, according to Popper?</li>
<li>Popper doesn&rsquo;t use the phrase “scientific method”; even so, what method of reasoning does he prescribe for science?</li>
<li>How might Hempel&rsquo;s Semmelweis case inform the debate we discussed about hypotheses?</li>
<li>What is wrong, as Hempel discusses, with the advice that scientists should address problems by first collecting all the relevant data and then second classifying it into groups?</li>
</ol>
