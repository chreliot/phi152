<h1><span class="title">Test 2 Questions</span></h1>

</div>

<main>
<p>This test is designed to take one hour. Complete it during the class period. Tests submitted by 10:10 AM on May 19 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at <code>the course Blackboard site &gt; Tests &gt; Test 2.</code></p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Choose <strong>six (6)</strong> of the questions below under “<strong>Questions</strong>” to work on. For each of those six questions, write a one-paragraph answer, not shorter than five sentences. For most, 6–7 sentences is a good range to aim for, in terms of length (though sentences vary in terms of content, of course, and very brief sentences may not convey as much as I&rsquo;m assuming in my estimate).</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your understanding of the course material. That includes the clarity of the answer, which includes defining any technical or unfamiliar terms you&rsquo;re using and writing in clear English.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials-and-assistance">Source materials and assistance</h2>
<p>While taking the test, you may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else (besides me, and I won&rsquo;t give anyone the answers). For the test answers, you <em>may</em> use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your class/reading notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text <em>from non-course materials or other students, without mentioning that you have done so in the form of a citation</em>,  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). More generally, in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> apparent degree of understanding — test answers repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that the test-takers not seem to understand will not earn good grades.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Inductive arguments, while never deductively valid, can have degrees of strength. The Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to justification, being inductive methods, therefore show the support for conclusions by degrees. What does “degree of support” for hypotheses mean in each of those approaches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does P(H|E) mean in the context of Bayes&rsquo;s Rule, what are the three terms used by the rule to evaluate P(H|E), and what do they each mean? (This answer could be a list the four terms with their meanings, expressed in sentences.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might frequentists criticize the Bayesian approach to scientific reasoning? How might Bayesians criticize the frequentist approach to scientific reasoning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You read the sentence in a science paper “Our experiment supported the hypothesis that ducks like water with p &lt; .05,” and the scientists were testing a null hypothesis corresponding to “ducks like water.” What does the “p &lt; .05” mean? What exactly has the experiment apparently shown?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two common misinterpretations of p-values? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is a probability statement: “There&rsquo;s an 80% chance of thunderstorms at Hofstra tomorrow.” In one sentence each, restate that sentence using each of the five interpretations of probability, without using the word “probability.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just north of New York City, Indian Point nuclear reactor closed this month. Opponents argued, successfully, that a nuclear accident there could be catastrophic for New York City. Advocates of the reactor argued that nuclear power is produced more cleanly and is therefore less harmful than the main alternative, coal-burning power plants, and that accidents are extremely rare. Do they disagree on probabilities or utilities or both? How might laying out a decision table have made the conversation about their disagreement more constructive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does a randomized controlled trial seek evidence for causation by trying to gather evidence about imaginary populations? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose your ears ring (a condition called “tinnitus”), and a doctor tells you, “A randomized controlled trial showed that a new drug called  Ring-Away works for tinnitus.” What about that is good news? And what do Deaton and Cartwright caution about that advice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A randomized controlled trial of twenty runners showed that six of the ten who smoked before running showed increased performance compared to a previous race (never mind how that was measured). But only 4/10 who did not smoke showed increased performance compared to their previous running race. Is smoking correlated with increased performance in this study? Is the difference significant? Why or why not?</p>
</li>
</ol>
