<p>The following specifies where, for your work in this course, parentheses are and are not optional in First Order Logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Textbook Section 26.4 allows us to omit the outermost brackets of any formula (so, “P⋁Q” is just as good as “(P⋁Q)”). And it allows square brackets (“[” and “]”) in place of parentheses wherever we feel it increases readability.</li>
<li>Our textbook generally does not put parentheses around quantifiers, like ∀x and ∃x. You may either leave them out or include them (as I <a href="/phi154/FOL-ExistentialQuantificationExercise.pdf">sometimes</a> have done). So: “∃xPx” is fine, and so is “(∃x)Px.”</li>
<li>Our textbook generally does put parentheses around terms (singular terms and variables). You may either leave them out or include them. So: “∃xPx” is fine, and so is ∃xP(x). “Pa” is fine, and so is “P(a).” “Lbb” is fine, and so is “L(bb),” and so is “L(b,b),” as our textbook normally puts it.</li>
<li><em>However</em>, there is one place where parentheses are really important in FOL, beyond where they&rsquo;re important in TFL: <strong>No variable may ever appear outside the scope of a quantifier</strong>, and the scope for compound sentences is delimited by parentheses. Another way of saying the same thing is that no variable may be “unbound,” and parentheses are used to “bind” variables.  “Scope” is defined, and scoping rules are discussed, in Section 23.5 and 26.2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The unifying thought behind points 1–4 above is that, in this course, we will treat parentheses as optional where they were merely decorative, and as required where adding or removing them can change a sentence&rsquo;s meaning or render it ambiguous.</p>
