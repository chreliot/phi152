<h1 id="hume">Hume</h1>
<p>Knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li>relations of ideas: the way ideas are connected [&ldquo;3 x 5 = 30 / 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Everything accurate is correct.&quot;] - true as a function of the meanings of the ideas involved.
<ul>
<li>A statement for which, once we define the ideas, it&rsquo;s <em>necessarily</em> true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>matters of fact: [&ldquo;Moisture can cause mold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Turtles have shells.&quot;]
<ul>
<li>A statement for which its contrary is still possible, in that it doesn&rsquo;t imply a contradiction, and it can be conceived clearly by the mind. [contrary: &ldquo;Moisture doesn&rsquo;t cause mold.&quot;]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(contrary of &ldquo;3 x 5 = 15&rdquo; is &ldquo;3 x 5 ≠ 15&rdquo; equivalent to &ldquo;1 ≠ 1&rdquo; — that <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be true.)</p>
<p>Hume applies this distinction to: “The sun will rise tomorrow.” It is a matter of fact.</p>
<p>How are the various observations of the sun rising connected to this further claim? The past risings must be connected to tomorrow&rsquo;s sunrise, if we can infer anything about tomorrow&rsquo;s from the past. How do we come to know about <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>We can come to know about anything through two kinds of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>deductive (&ldquo;demonstrative&rdquo;)</li>
<li>inductive (&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hume will argue that neither of these kinds of reasoning can support that the sun will rise tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re discussing reasoning about claims like &ldquo;All A&rsquo;s are B&rsquo;s&rdquo;
The next A that we observe will be B.</p>
<p>(This is a case of enumerative induction.)</p>
<p>Enumerative induction: Inferring about a new case based on adding up past cases.</p>
<p>Can we justify the use of enumerative induction? It would need to be through deductive or inductive reasoning. It would require support for</p>
<p>PUN (“Principle of the Uniformity of Nature”): The future will be like the past.</p>
<p>This is a hidden premise in the argument &ldquo;All A&rsquo;s have been B&rsquo;s, So, the next A will also be B.&rdquo; (the inductive argument) principle is <em>assumed</em> in any support for matters of fact like that the sun will rise tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can we justify the PUN? If we can justify it, the reasoning would proceed</p>
<ul>
<li>deductively? (But it is not entailed by anything in our observations. It can&rsquo;t be deduced. Nothing in our experience guarantees the PUN is true.)</li>
<li>inductively? e.g., PUN has been true in the past, so it will be true in the future. (circular!: Any inductive argument for the PUN must rely on the PUN itself. This is &ldquo;begging the question,&rdquo; assuming what you&rsquo;re trying to prove.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there is no way of <em>reasoning</em> in support of conclusions like &ldquo;The sun will rise tomorrow.&rdquo; So, there&rsquo;s no logical reason Billy&rsquo;s inductive principle must be wrong.</p>
<h2 id="humes-solution">Hume&rsquo;s solution</h2>
<p>When we expect outcomes, inductively, that&rsquo;s our psychology working, not our rationality. Our psychology has us project the past into the future. But this isn&rsquo;t logical.</p>
