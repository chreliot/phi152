<h2 id="mid-semester-advisories">Mid-semester Advisories</h2>
<p>Hofstra faculty issue mid-semester advisories in the seventh week of the semester to let students know if they think there is a reason for concern, at that early stage, about their performance so far in the course. It is a preliminary flag, early in the semester, that there may be reason for concern at that point. As the Provost&rsquo;s website <a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/provost/mid-semester-advisory.html">instructs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is expected that students receive early advisory that reflects on their progress in their courses. The policy applies to all fall and spring full-term undergraduate courses. The mid-semester advisory is a simple indication of student performance to date:  “satisfactory” / “reason for concern”.  Mid-semester advisories should be submitted by the seventh week of the Fall and Spring semester. The mid-semester advisory does not get computed directly into the final grade for the course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mid-semester advisory is therefore for not itself factored into a student&rsquo;s course grade, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the student will do poorly in the course when final grades are issued.</p>
<p>If an advisory is issued for a student—that there is &ldquo;reason for concern&rdquo;—the student will receive an email notice including instructions for viewing the advisory online.</p>
<p>Staff at the Center for University Advisement and other appropriate University offices can also see an advisory and any attached comments. The goal of this inclusion is that if anyone at the university is positioned to help a student get on track, they are brought into the loop early in the semester. That means everyone can work together toward trying to make the course go better, including earning desired grades.</p>
<p>I issue mid-semester advisories for students whose grades to date are trending toward C– or below or for whom there is another serious issue like missing a lot of classes.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions about mid-semester advisories.</p>
