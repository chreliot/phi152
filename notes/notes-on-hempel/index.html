<h2 id="hempel">Hempel</h2>
<h3 id="semmelweis">Semmelweis</h3>
<p>Hypotheses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Atmospheric/cosmic hypothesis -
but: effects are inconsistent with how this cause would work - significant data that is not explained by this cause</li>
<li>Psychological hypothesis -
test: removes and moves putative cause; outcome: effect doesn&rsquo;t change</li>
<li>Position of delivery hypothesis -
test: removes putative cause; outcome: effect doesn&rsquo;t change</li>
<li>Cadaveric matter hypothesis -
test: remove putative cause by hand-washing; effect: dramatic change
further support: it explains the 1st/2nd ward mortality difference because the
mechanism is absent in second ward, also explained mortality diff. in street births
[compare: Whewell&rsquo;s “consilience of inductions”]</li>
<li>Putrid matter derived from living organisms hypothesis
suggested by cases where no cadaver is present</li>
</ol>
<p>Semmelweis had <em>confirmation</em> for hypothesis 3 (cadaveric matter).</p>
<p>Affirming the consequent: If P then Q, and Q, so P.</p>
<p>Treating the hypothesis (3 or 4) as true when confirmed would be affirming the consequent — a logical error.</p>
<p>Semmelweis succeeded at creatively generating hypotheses, and systematically rejecting hypotheses until he arrives at a hypothesis he can&rsquo;t reject. So, he tests related cases and improves it. He&rsquo;s left not with the truth, but with something close — a knowledge of how to intervene on the system to change the effects.</p>
<h3 id="modus-tollens-reasoning">Modus tollens reasoning</h3>
<p>If we define,</p>
<ul>
<li>H: hypothesis</li>
<li>I: a test implication of that hypothesis — something the hypothesis makes true of a situation</li>
</ul>
<p>Modus tollens reasoning has the pattern:</p>
<pre><code>If H is true, then so is I.   
(If the first division women are dying from delivering on backs (H), 
  then they won't die as much when they deliver on their sides (I))
But (as the evidence shows) I is *not* true.
_____________
So, H is not true.
</code></pre><p>This modus tollens reasoning is deductively valid — if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.</p>
<h3 id="affirming-the-consequent-reasoning">Affirming the consequent reasoning</h3>
<pre><code>If H is true, then so is I.
(As the evidence shows) I is true.
__________________
So, H is true.
</code></pre><p>This reasoning is deductively invalid - its premises may be true <em>and</em> its conclusion false.</p>
<h3 id="hempels-critique-of-naïve-scientific-method">Hempel&rsquo;s critique of naïve scientific method</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>observe and record all the facts</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: It&rsquo;s impossible to observe all the facts, nor even more than almost none of them!</li>
<li>BUT: But observe all the relevant facts?
<ul>
<li>BUT: Relevant to what?</li>
<li>BUT: Relevant to a particular problem.
<ul>
<li>BUT: problems aren&rsquo;t sufficient for focusing attention; need hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>analyze and classify all the facts</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: without hypotheses, analysis and classification are blind (3)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Very difficult to untangle actual causation from data</li>
<li>Symptoms might differ among cases of the same kind, and so not be classified together (though they belong together)</li>
<li>Same condition might present itself differently in different cases</li>
<li>Even describing symptoms normally introduces hypotheses about them!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>inductively derive generalizations from them (without introducing hypotheses)</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: “Scientific hypotheses and theories are not derived from the observed facts, but invented to account for them. … They constitute guesses.” (15)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>further test the generalizations</p>
</li>
</ol>
