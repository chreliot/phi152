<p>This note about grading and interpreting grades  just adds some detail to what the course syllabus already says about grading.</p>
<h2 id="4-point-scale">4-point scale</h2>
<p>Grades in this course are assigned and calculated using Hofstra&rsquo;s 4-point scale (described  <a href="http://bulletin.hofstra.edu/content.php?catoid=91&amp;navoid=11490&amp;hl=four-point&amp;returnto=search#cumulative_gpa">here</a> in the <em>Hofstra Bulletin</em>). Following the <em>Bulletin</em>, the alphabetical grades, including plus (+) and minus (–), have the following 4-point scale values (and vice versa):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">letter</th>
<th align="right">4pt</th>
<th align="left">Student’s academic performance …</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">A</td>
<td align="right">4.0</td>
<td align="left">“was of honors level.”</td>

<h2 id="writing-assignment-grades">Writing assignment grades</h2>
<p>Writing assignments will be scored with a maximum of 40 points. To convert your grade from this raw score to a <a href="#4-point-scale">4-point scale</a>, simply move the decimal point one place to the left (or, equivalently divide by 10). So, for example, a grade of 27/40 becomes 2.7 out of 4.0, which (following the table above) is equivalent to a B– letter-scale grade. In this case, the value used to figure the overall course grade (as below) will be the 4-point-scale grade, 2.7. (Why not just post the 4-point grade and not mess with the score out of 40? Because the Blackboard interface only accepts whole numbers. 😑.)</p>
<h2 id="test-grades">Test grades</h2>
<p>Each answer on tests is scored on an 8-point scale which converts to <a href="#4-point-scale">4-point scale</a>. The overall test grade is the answers&rsquo; scores added together. For example, if there were six test questions, then the highest possible grade would be 48 (= 6 questions x 8 possible points on each question).</p>
<p>The reason I use 8 points per question is that the Blackboard grade book does not allow half grades (like 3.5/4.0), and I think they&rsquo;re useful. So, when I read answers, I grade on a 4-point scale and then multiply by two. A 3.5/4.0 answer is given 7 points (= 3.5 x 2).</p>
<p>The way to calculate an overall test grade to a 4-point scale is therefore to divide the overall score by the number of questions times 2. For example, if you got a 30/48 on a 6-question test, your 4-point grade would be 30 points divided by (6 questions x 2), which is 2.5. On the 4-point scale, 2.5 is equivalent to a C+.</p>
<p>On this system, your overall grade on the test is just the average of the scores you earned on each question (with the twist that I have to multiply by 2 and then divide by 2).</p>
<h2 id="overall-course-grades">Overall course grades</h2>
<p>Overall course grades will be calculated using the following percentages from the syllabus:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Component</th>
<th align="center">Fraction of total</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Participation</td>
<td align="center">15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Assignments</td>
<td align="center">30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">First Test</td>
<td align="center">25%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Second Test</td>
<td align="center">30%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Final grades will be calculated on a <a href="#4-point-scale">4-point scale</a> and then converted to letter-scale for posting to Hofstra&rsquo;s final grade system online.</p>
