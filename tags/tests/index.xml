      <description>Our first test will, unless circumstances intervene, take place during class on DATE COMING SOON.
Further information coming soon.

On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions.</description>
