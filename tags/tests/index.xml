      <title>Test 2 Questions</title>

      <description>This test is designed to take one hour. Complete it during the class period. Tests submitted by 10:10 AM on May 19 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at the course Blackboard site &amp;gt; Tests &amp;gt; Test 2.
Instructions Choose six (6) of the questions below under “Questions” to work on. For each of those six questions, write a one-paragraph answer, not shorter than five sentences. For most, 6–7 sentences is a good range to aim for, in terms of length (though sentences vary in terms of content, of course, and very brief sentences may not convey as much as I&amp;rsquo;m assuming in my estimate).</description>
