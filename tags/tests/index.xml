      <description>This note about grading and interpreting grades just adds some detail to what the course syllabus already says about grading.
4-point scale Grades in this course are assigned and calculated using Hofstra&amp;rsquo;s 4-point scale (described here in the Hofstra Bulletin). Following the Bulletin, the alphabetical grades, including plus (+) and minus (–), have the following 4-point scale values (and vice versa):

      <description>Our first test will take place during class on March 16.
Content We opened the course with the idea of logic, thinking about the possibility of a logic of scientific reasoning. We developed enough understanding of deductive logic to understand examples of it, and its strengths and limitations. We then contrasted it with the idea of inductive logic, thinking about its goals and limitations, as well. We considered, in a way that continued into our examination of various philosophers&amp;rsquo;s accounts, what roles deductive and inductive logic each might play in scientific reasoning.</description>
