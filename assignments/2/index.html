<p>Upload your assignment to the Blackboard link for “Assignment 2” any time before the March 8 class. (I originally said Friday March 5, but I&rsquo;m adding in some extra time, in case you want it.)</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>In chapter 2 (page 201, or 11) of <em>Philosophy of Natural Science</em>, Hempel quotes a statement of the scientific method from an economics textbook, and then develops several criticisms of it. The following ask you to, similarly, find an example in the wild and (briefly) critically analyze it. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find a statement or characterization of the scientific method. Ideally, for this purpose, its length should be not much longer than a paragraph or maybe two. Reproduce it by taking a picture, or making a screenshot of it, or even transcribing it, or whatever method makes it easy for you to save and share it as part of your submission. A great possible source for this would be science textbooks you have from courses at any level. If you&rsquo;ve taken college science courses, those might offer the most interesting material to engage. The top Google hit isn&rsquo;t necessarily going to be something interesting to engage; if you possibly can, find something in a book, or at least some source more serious than, like, SparkNotes or ScienceIzFun or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a paragraph—about one page double-spaced or less than that single spaced—describing and offering critical comments about this example of the scientific method you collected in the wild (above), drawing on the course&rsquo;s discussion to date. <em>Some</em> of the questions you <em>might</em> consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it describe deductive or inductive reasoning, explicitly or implicitly?</li>
<li>Does it say anything about the specific logic or reasoning the method employs?</li>
<li>Does it describe the use of hypotheses, and if so, anything about how they&rsquo;re generated?</li>
<li>Does it say what the goal of the scientific method is?</li>
<li>Does it include ideas we haven&rsquo;t discussed?</li>
<li>Is it subject to any of the criticisms raised by our authors so far (e.g., Hempel&rsquo;s), or to any of the criticisms we&rsquo;ve made of their ideas?</li>
<li>Do you think all science be done the way this account describes?</li>
<li>If you were to set out to do some science just following these instructions, could you? Is its prescription too vague to be followed, for instance? What could it be more specific about?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
