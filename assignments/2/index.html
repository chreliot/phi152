<p>Upload your assignment to the Blackboard link for “Assignment 2” by <strong>February 16</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the brief sketch of scientific method you wrote out during our exercise in class.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Write that out briefly.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (about 3–4 sentences)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the steps in, or parts of, your representation of scientific method. Do any of the moves involve deductive reasoning? Do any of the moves involve inductive reasoning?  (By “moves” I mean: If someone were to try to do science using your method, what are the steps they would probably take?) Write about 4–5 sentences about which parts are deductive or inductive, and how/why. If you&rsquo;re having trouble coming up with enough content for this, thinking about what else <em>besides what you&rsquo;ve explicitly written out</em> someone would have to do to do science using your account, and ask these questions about those parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write 3–4 sentences about <em>one</em> of the following, as appropriate:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If your answer above has your method employing exclusively deductive reasoning, Is your method able to support any <em>general</em> scientific claims or hypotheses? How?</li>
<li><strong>Or</strong>, if your answer contains some inductive reasoning—and I expect most students are in this category—are there any ways it has, or could produce <em>inductive strength</em> in supporting certain claims or hypotheses?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: the point of this exercise was <strong>not</strong> to get the right answer to this question. You may well have the right answer, but it was your initial reflections I was looking for, not some correct answer.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>If you were not in class the day we did that exercise, instead write out about 3–4 sentences answering the following question: What&rsquo;s the scientific method?&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
