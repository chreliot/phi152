<li>
<p><strong>Bayes without numbers</strong>: Suppose you have a hypothesis, on the first day of class, that the course will have 50% first-year students (FYS) in it. The evidence you have available to you is that when the first two students walk in, they are both first year-students. <em>Without doing a calculation</em>, write a paragraph discussing how you might use Bayes&rsquo;s rule to think about how this evidence might change your confidence in your hypothesis. Specifically, how would you assess the significance of this evidence? What further information would you need to do so, if any?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assessing correlation</strong>: A campus dining-service study found that of 500 students randomly polled, half of whom were seniors, 55% of Seniors like pizza more than pasta, while only 45% of non-Seniors like pizza more than pasta. Based on estimation theory, Does their study provide meaningful evidence that there is a correlation between being a senior and preferring pizza (to pasta)? Draw a rectangular diagram of the population, like we&rsquo;ve done in class, to think about and illustrate your answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misunderstanding significance</strong>: A science article tested whether a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuboomin, alleviates headaches. It reports that in a study, “taking a pill of Ibuboomin was significantly related to disappearance of headaches (p=0.04).” At the bottom of the paper, they write, further, &ldquo;So, Ibuboomin cures headaches with a probability of 96%.&rdquo; (a) What exactly is the error the science article commits in drawing this conclusion from the significance test? (b) What does the reported significance test actually show, instead?</p>
